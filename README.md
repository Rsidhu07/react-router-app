# react-router-app
This is a basic react app made using CRA template for showing routes, protected route. 1. Create a login form with email and password validation (email validation, password must be 8 char long, both the fields should not be empty) 2. Create it using functional component 3. Save users input in local storage 4. Only one user is allowed to go to the protected route (username: task@gmail.com , password: 12345678), you can store these creds in code to compare user input. 5. After login create a Demo component that should only be accessible if the userâ€™s data store in localstorage. There are two routes available after login 'dash-board' and 'protected-route'.
